This program uses Java Native Access to interface with a native C library so that we can run
system commands while still using Java. 

The goal of this particular instance is to catch the ctr c character getting sent from the parent process
to the child process (in this case, petite, which is a scheme interpreter). By using our own pipe, we get
to watch what is getting sent from the parent to the child and then grab it before it gets written. 

Ultimately, the parent of this program will be JEdit, and this will be part of a Scheme plugin for JEdit. 
More code to follow later. 

To test this out in the terminal, be sure you have petite installed on your machine, and then run the 
program with: make run.
You will get a scheme REPL but if you press ctrl v then ctrl c, you will see that the program catches the character.
(the ctrl v tells the terminal that this is a literal character). 

P.S. since we catch ctrl c, ctrl d will let you exit.
